## Components

### 1. Simple Service Webapp

We have a `as simple as possible` Golang application, and your first mission is to create a Docker image for it. 

Checkout the project: https://github.com/Onefootball/simple-service.git

- Create a `Dockerfile` for it.
- Push it to an **container repository** (ecr, gcr, docker-hub etc) of your choice. Why? Needed in `[2]`

Please use the private `GitHub` repository created for you and commit your work there.
So, In the end, we will review your steps and decide the next step in the interview process.

### 2. Setup Kubernetes

- Install `kubeadm` or `minikube` in your local workstation to deploy image build in `[1]`.
- Create K8s' `Service` running with `HPA` configured to use CPU for scaling.
- Deploy a `StatefulSet pod` which needs persistency. You can deploy anything, for ex: Mysql, Redis, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ and so on.
- Extend the app built in `[1]` or create another app (if you are not comfortable with golang) which can do simple interaction (for ex: [redis ping-pong](https://redis.io/commands/ping)) with the stateful pod.

### 3. Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)

- Setup basic `monitoring` for the StatefulSet pod (**sidecar container** can be helpful if container natively doesn't expose metrics) which can be scraped by prometheus engine.
- Deploy `Prometheus` for monitoring targets (only stateful services)
- `[BONUS]` Deploy `Grafana` to plot dashboard. Grafana community has dashboards which can be used in this case. 

Examples:

- https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/4279
- https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/4031
