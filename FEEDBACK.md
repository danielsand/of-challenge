#### tiny EKS Cluster for the Challenger

i spend a bigger portion of my time on getting minikube running and also expierienced problems with the ingress controller (enabling metrics for prometheus is possbile but hacky) and the overlay network.

to get a immutable starting point and tiny EKS cluster and a kubeconfig for the Challenger can be really helpful and also shows the ability to work in AWS and in a hetrogenous environment
